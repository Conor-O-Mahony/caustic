#Conor O Mahony - Web App Development Assignment 1

## Caustic
A site for about music for lovers of music. Here one will find music history, reviews and my personal taste.

##General Accessibility

- On mobile and smaller screen devices (less than 650px), the navbar is floated below the logo, the album table fonts are decreased, the gallery images are rescaled and the album overlay text font is decreased. This is done to improve accessibility.

- In order to keep the user on the website, target="_blank" was added to a tags to open links in a new window.

- overflow:scroll; was added to the tables in order to make them readable on small screens. Smarter solutions could be used in the future such as floating the overflowing columns to a new row.

- Embedded videos were added to the site in more wordy sections to give the viewer an alternative to reading

## Exploring CSS

- Animated backgrounds with keyframes were added to genre pages to make more fun and visually appealing. The background transition images were preloaded to prevent flickering while loading https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49216762/why-is-the-background-flashing-flickering-when-transitioning-to-another-image-c

- Various background types such as radial gradient and complex zig-zag linear gradient backgrounds were explored to make the site more visually appealing.

- Animated overlay boxes were added to the albums page which appear on hover. This is done by utilising the ease-in-out transition.
